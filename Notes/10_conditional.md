# If...Else Condition in Python

## Overview

The `if...else` statement in Python is used to perform different actions based on whether a certain condition is true or false. It allows the program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code accordingly.

## Syntax

```python
if condition:
    # Code block to execute if condition is true
else:
    # Code block to execute if condition is false
```

## Example

```python
x = 10

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
else:
    print("x is not positive")
```

## Explanation

- In this example, the variable `x` is assigned the value 10.
- The `if` statement checks whether `x` is greater than 0.
- If the condition `x > 0` evaluates to `True`, the statement `print("x is positive")` is executed.
- If the condition is `False`, the `else` block is executed, which prints `"x is not positive"`.

## Nested If...Else

```python
x = 10

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
elif x == 0:
    print("x is zero")
else:
    print("x is negative")
```

## Explanation

- This example extends the previous one with an additional condition using `elif` (short for "else if").
- If `x` is greater than 0, it prints `"x is positive"`.
- If `x` equals 0, it prints `"x is zero"`.
- Otherwise, if neither of the above conditions is met, it prints `"x is negative"`.

## Conclusion

The `if...else` statement is fundamental in Python programming, allowing developers to create decision-making processes within their code, leading to more flexible and powerful applications.
