### Mutable and Immutable in Python

In Python, objects can be classified into two categories based on their mutability: **mutable** and **immutable**.

**Immutable objects** are those whose state cannot be modified after creation. Examples of immutable objects in Python include integers, floats, strings, tuples, and frozensets. When you try to modify the value of an immutable object, Python creates a new object instead of modifying the existing one.

**Mutable objects**, on the other hand, can be modified after creation. Examples of mutable objects in Python include lists, dictionaries, sets, and user-defined classes. When you modify a mutable object, the changes are applied to the existing object.

Here's a simple explanation with examples:

#### Immutable Objects:
```python
# Immutable objects
x = 5  # integer
y = "hello"  # string
z = (1, 2, 3)  # tuple

# Trying to modify immutable objects
# Results in creating new objects instead of modifying the existing ones
# Example with integer
x += 1
print(x)  # Output: 6
# Example with string
y += " world"
print(y)  # Output: hello world
# Example with tuple
# This will raise a TypeError since tuples are immutable
z[0] = 10
```

#### Mutable Objects:
```python
# Mutable objects
a = [1, 2, 3]  # list
b = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}  # dictionary

# Modifying mutable objects
# Changes are applied to the existing objects
# Example with list
a.append(4)
print(a)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
# Example with dictionary
b['c'] = 3
print(b)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

Understanding mutability in Python is crucial because it affects how you work with objects, especially when dealing with functions, methods, and assignments. Remembering the distinction between mutable and immutable objects can help prevent unexpected behavior and bugs in your code.
