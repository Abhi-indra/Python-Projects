## Dictionaries and Methods in Python

Dictionaries, also known as associative arrays or hash tables, are essential data structures in Python for storing collections of key-value pairs. Unlike lists that rely on order, dictionaries provide a flexible way to map unique keys to their corresponding values. This document explores key methods for creating, manipulating, and accessing data within dictionaries.

**1. Creating Dictionaries:**

There are two primary ways to create dictionaries in Python:

* **Curly braces `{}`:** Enclose key-value pairs separated by colons (`:`), with keys and values being of any data type. Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
fruits_and_prices = {"apple": 1.50, "banana": 0.75, "orange": 2.00}
```

* **`dict()` constructor:** Can be used to create empty dictionaries or convert key-value pairs from other iterables:

```python
empty_dict = dict()
another_dict = dict(person)  # Creates a copy of an existing dictionary
```

**2. Accessing Elements:**

- **Using Keys:** Access a value by its corresponding key within square brackets `[]`. Keys must be unique and immutable.

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
name = person["name"]  # Output: Alice
age = person["age"]  # Output: 30
```

- **`get(key, default=None)`:** Retrieves the value associated with a key. If the key is not found, it returns the specified default value (defaults to `None`).

```python
fruits = {"apple": 1.50, "banana": 0.75}
price_of_mango = fruits.get("mango", 0.00)  # Output: 0.00 (since "mango" is not a key)
```

**3. Modifying Dictionaries:**

- **Adding Key-Value Pairs:** Use assignment within square brackets `[]` to add new key-value pairs.

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
person["city"] = "New York"  # Modified dictionary: {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
```

- **Updating Values:** Assign a new value to an existing key to update it.

```python
fruits = {"apple": 1.50, "banana": 0.75}
fruits["apple"] = 2.00  # Modified dictionary: {"apple": 2.00, "banana": 0.75}
```

- **Removing Key-Value Pairs:**
    - `pop(key)`: Removes the key-value pair and returns the value associated with the key. Raises a `KeyError` if the key is not found.
    - `del dictionary[key]`: Deletes the key-value pair without returning anything.

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
removed_age = person.pop("age")  # Output: 30, Modified dictionary: {"name": "Alice", "city": "New York"}
del person["city"]  # Modified dictionary: {"name": "Alice"}
```

**4. Common Dictionary Methods:**

- **`clear()`:** Removes all key-value pairs from the dictionary, leaving it empty.
- **`copy()`:** Creates a shallow copy of the dictionary (changes to the copy won't affect the original).
- **`keys()`:** Returns a view of all the keys in the dictionary as a dictionary view object.
- **`values()`:** Returns a view of all the values in the dictionary as a dictionary view object.
- **`items()`:** Returns a view of all the key-value pairs in the dictionary as tuples in a dictionary view object. These views are dynamic and reflect changes made to the original dictionary.
- **`in (key)`:** Checks if a key exists in the dictionary. Returns `True` if found, `False` otherwise.
